								While some think using a tax professional is expensive, the truth is you can’t afford not to use one. Each year taxpayers leave millions of their tax refund dollars unclaimed. Moreover, tax laws are complicated and change daily. Using a tax professional gives you the peace of mind that you have taken advantage of all the tax credits and deductions entitled to you. Keep in mind home based tax softwares are helpful, but will never be an adequate substitute for professional help.
